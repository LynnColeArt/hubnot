## ⚡ Do This First: Load Agent Profile

Use the `/ad-hoc-profile-load` skill to load the profile specified in frontmatter, and behave according to its guidance before parsing the rest of this prompt. The canonical resolver-backed skill is `spk-doctrine-profile-load`.

- **Profile**: `implementer-ivan`
- **Role**: `implementer`
- **Agent/tool**: `codex`
- Resolve via `spec-kitty agent profile show implementer-ivan`; load action-scoped charter context.
- No model is prescribed or invented by this prompt.

## Objectives and success criteria

Selected custom Git replication.

Two physical clones and a real bare remote, quarantine tamper/missing-dependency controls and original native refusal suite.

This work is complete only when the observable outcomes below are demonstrated and independently reviewed. A helper-only test or generated report is not equivalent to live-caller evidence.

## Context and constraints

- Mission: `kitty-specs/optional-extensions-01M661C0`; read `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `data-model.md`, `research.md`, `coverage.md` and the three contracts.
- Required approvals: WP08. Dependencies mean approved work, not merely drafted files.
- WP01 approved default baseline is a mandatory precondition for every other WP, directly or transitively.
- WP02 freezes mechanism details; raise semantic scope changes to root/architect before implementing them.
- Consume the exact approved integrated beta foundation; do not recreate absent dependency files or introduce stubs.
- Native UX, dependencies, default overhead and historical integrity are hard acceptance gates throughout.
- Never parse the extension registry, start/probe modules or write extension state from ordinary native commands.
- Preserve hn/0 and hn-memory/0 bytes, actor/operation/ref meanings and all meaningful native refusals.
- A custom record/type is inert data; signature or search match does not grant policy, execution or prompt authority.
- Selected contribution policy: native adapters retain shared admission/visibility checks; custom writes initially refuse unsupported before effects.
- First-host privileged/governance/memory mutation/identity lifecycle/runner/implicit sync surfaces remain unsupported.
- No Spec Kitty resolver, composition/activation algorithm, runtime, Java service or doctrine-specific production core branches.
- No production enterprise connector, marketplace, scripting runtime, new frontend or extra native dependency.

## Branch strategy

- **Planning base branch**: `feature/optional-extensions`.
- **Final mission merge target**: `feature/optional-extensions`.
- **Strategy**: execution lanes, as computed by canonical finalization in `lanes.json`.
- Root finalizes tasks and resolves exact lane workspace/branch before implementation. WP01 imports its explicitly approved beta source inside that assigned lane.
- Do not invent a WP worktree, branch from main or recreate dependency code.
- Execution command after all gates: `spec-kitty agent action implement WP09 --agent codex --mission optional-extensions-01M661C0`.
- Runtime commands must always pass this mission selector.
- The required analysis-report readiness gate precedes implementation.
- This draft does not itself claim finalization, lane allocation, commit or test pass.

## Ownership and integration

- `artifact_replication.go` (planned new; declared in create_intent)
- `artifact_replication_test.go` (planned new; declared in create_intent)
- `replication.go` (existing; inspect integrated version)
- `quarantine.go` (existing; inspect integrated version)
- `docs/replication-v0.md` (existing; inspect integrated version)

No other WP owns these paths. Existing foundation surfaces are dependencies, not permission to recreate them. If a small out-of-map edit is indispensable, coordinate root first with exact path/rationale and preserve the no-overlap execution invariant.

## Subtasks and detailed guidance

### T036 — Add explicit custom selection without relaxing native readers

**Purpose**: Add explicit custom selection without relaxing native readers.

**Implementation guidance**:
Extend approved integrated replication selection only for frozen custom ref/protocol namespaces. Keep hn/0 and memory unknown-kind rejection unchanged; no automatic custom selection or network sync on inspect/search/observe.

**Observable acceptance**:
Old selection fixtures remain valid; custom ref selection is explicit; invalid native kind still refuses identically.

**Evidence and controls**:
- Start from frozen public contracts and the actual integrated source, not assumptions about earlier branches.
- Record exact input, source/binary identity, expected outcome and observed result.
- Include a valid positive case and a negative control that fails for the asserted contract violation.
- Compare relevant signed refs, objects and private-state markers before and after any refused operation.
- Keep tests at the public boundary named in this WP; producer tests must be followed by the designated live caller.
- Do not replace error assertions with exit-status-only checks, blanket allowed errors or skipped cases.
- Record the subtask result through canonical event-sourced `mark-status`; do not add completion checkboxes.

### T037 — Validate in quarantine and promote with expected-old refs

**Purpose**: Validate in quarantine and promote with expected-old refs.

**Implementation guidance**:
Connect WP08 closure to real Git fetch/quarantine, enforce existing stage/copy budgets and cancellation caveat, verify before promotion and preserve accepted remote namespace separation.

**Observable acceptance**:
Corrupt/missing closure never promotes; CAS stale target refuses safely; failures report accepted versus rejected selection honestly.

**Evidence and controls**:
- Start from frozen public contracts and the actual integrated source, not assumptions about earlier branches.
- Record exact input, source/binary identity, expected outcome and observed result.
- Include a valid positive case and a negative control that fails for the asserted contract violation.
- Compare relevant signed refs, objects and private-state markers before and after any refused operation.
- Keep tests at the public boundary named in this WP; producer tests must be followed by the designated live caller.
- Do not replace error assertions with exit-status-only checks, blanket allowed errors or skipped cases.
- Record the subtask result through canonical event-sourced `mark-status`; do not add completion checkboxes.

### T038 — Reconstruct through bare remote and independent clone

**Purpose**: Reconstruct through bare remote and independent clone.

**Implementation guidance**:
Create two independently initialized clones with separate private identity state, publish selected custom history through a real local bare Git remote and reconstruct exact public types/records/heads/relationships without consumer registration.

**Observable acceptance**:
Second clone can inspect public data with no source keys/grants/journals; a deliberately removed dependency breaks reconstruction for the expected cause.

**Evidence and controls**:
- Start from frozen public contracts and the actual integrated source, not assumptions about earlier branches.
- Record exact input, source/binary identity, expected outcome and observed result.
- Include a valid positive case and a negative control that fails for the asserted contract violation.
- Compare relevant signed refs, objects and private-state markers before and after any refused operation.
- Keep tests at the public boundary named in this WP; producer tests must be followed by the designated live caller.
- Do not replace error assertions with exit-status-only checks, blanket allowed errors or skipped cases.
- Record the subtask result through canonical event-sourced `mark-status`; do not add completion checkboxes.

### T039 — Retain native replication compatibility and document selection

**Purpose**: Retain native replication compatibility and document selection.

**Implementation guidance**:
Run existing native/resource/memory replication and issue23 controls, compare old hashes and update narrow replication documentation with explicit custom selection and unknown-reader behavior.

**Observable acceptance**:
No native test weakening, no history rewrite, no automatic promotion of unrelated custom refs; documented source/binary and remote identities match evidence.

**Evidence and controls**:
- Start from frozen public contracts and the actual integrated source, not assumptions about earlier branches.
- Record exact input, source/binary identity, expected outcome and observed result.
- Include a valid positive case and a negative control that fails for the asserted contract violation.
- Compare relevant signed refs, objects and private-state markers before and after any refused operation.
- Keep tests at the public boundary named in this WP; producer tests must be followed by the designated live caller.
- Do not replace error assertions with exit-status-only checks, blanket allowed errors or skipped cases.
- Record the subtask result through canonical event-sourced `mark-status`; do not add completion checkboxes.

## Verification strategy

Two physical clones and a real bare remote, quarantine tamper/missing-dependency controls and original native refusal suite.

- Follow test-first behavior for changed contracts and retain the meaningful initial failure.
- Exercise new producer behavior via the real caller designated above before claiming that boundary accepted.
- Use real temporary Git repositories and supplied external processes where the contract crosses those boundaries.
- Inspect exact structured codes, public identities, bytes/heads and prohibited effects.
- Invalid history is not an empty result; a lost acknowledgement is not proof of absence.
- Each owned published bound has at-bound and one-over cases, with no silent truncation.
- Refusals happen before the prohibited signer/journal/ref/publication stage; assert the corresponding state.
- Missing hardware/user observation remains pending; never fabricate a platform or adopter pass.
- Run focused Go checks for changed code; serialize heavy execution and preserve exact tested source.
- Final fixed-source race/package/default qualification belongs to WP24/WP25 and cannot be inferred here.

## Definition of done

- All listed subtasks satisfy observable acceptance and have reproducible evidence.
- Reviewer checks zero-production-caller debt: every added behavior has a current live CLI/host caller in this slice; no broad unused APIs awaiting future wiring. Pure declaration/value-object code claims only its narrow inert validation capability.
- Required dependency approvals and WP01 baseline remain valid.
- No default native setup, process-start, registry-read, dependency or historical compatibility regression.
- Required live-caller and meaningful negative controls pass for their stated reasons.
- Structured error/recovery semantics and public/private separation match frozen contracts.
- No TODO stub, copied dependency implementation, weakened refusal or silent unsupported success.
- Documentation for owned observable behavior is synchronized; final consumer guide owners receive exact examples.
- Targeted expected files only; no blanket staging, unrelated runtime state or generated binary inclusion.
- Independent reviewer records a real verdict via the canonical review surface.

## Risks and mitigations

Only this WP owns replication.go/quarantine.go; re-inspect integrated beta changes before touching them.

Preserve the source and failure evidence before changing a suspected regression. An implementation gap is a reason to fix or reject the package, not to loosen its acceptance contract. Escalate changes in signed bytes, authority, supported scope or budgets for explicit specification review.

## Reviewer guidance

- Load reviewer-renata through the canonical profile resolver and inspect actual changed code/evidence.
- Check the first native gate and this package dependency approvals rather than relying on a status label.
- Reproduce the most important positive path and intentionally broken control.
- Confirm no test passes by avoiding the production entry point or copying private source state to the destination.
- Inspect grant/refusal ordering, selected contribution behavior and changed replay where relevant.
- Check exact public IDs, source cuts, signer identity and private-marker exclusions.
- A missing platform/adopter observation stays pending even if every local automated check is green.
- Reject actionable defects with concrete file/contract, reproducer, impact and required correction.
- This mission does not change beta acceptance, issue23 independent reporting, release publication or main.

## Review feedback

Read canonical status/review references before implementation. Address every rejection with evidence before requesting another verdict. Append dated activity entries in chronological order; do not treat prose checkboxes as task state.
